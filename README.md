# simulation

The essence of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world inhabited by eaters and predators. In addition to existence, the world contains resources (grass) that herbivores feed on and static objects that can be interacted with - they just take up space.

The 2D world is an NxM matrix, each creature or object contains cells of a cell, the presence of several objects/creatures in a cell is unacceptable.

The goal of the project is to develop object-oriented programming skills, as well as algorithms and data structures. For example, path search is implemented using the A-star algorithm, which in turn is based on breadth-first search and Dijkstra's algorithm. A directed graph based on an adjacency list has been implemented.
